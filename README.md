🎧 # **Spotify Data Pipeline using Python, AWS, and Snowflake**
🛠️ Technology Stack
Python

AWS Cloud Services

S3 (Simple Storage Service)

AWS Lambda

Amazon CloudWatch

Snowflake (Data Warehouse)

📌 Project Overview
This end-to-end data pipeline project extracts music-related data from the Spotify API using Python, performs data transformation, and loads the cleaned data into Snowflake for analytics and reporting. The architecture is designed to be serverless, event-driven, and scalable using AWS services.

☁️ AWS Components
🔹 Amazon S3
Raw Storage: Stores the unprocessed data extracted from the Spotify API.

Transformed Storage: Holds the cleaned and processed data after transformation.

🔹 AWS Lambda
Data Extraction Function: Connects to the Spotify API, fetches raw music data, and uploads it to an S3 bucket.

Data Transformation Function: Reads raw data from S3, applies necessary transformations using Python, and saves the output back to another S3 location.

🔹 Amazon CloudWatch
Used to schedule and trigger Lambda functions at regular intervals for automated data extraction and processing.

❄️ Snowflake Integration
The transformed data stored in S3 is ingested into Snowflake using Snowpipe, enabling:

Real-time or near-real-time data ingestion

Seamless integration between S3 and Snowflake

Automated loading into defined Snowflake tables for downstream analytics

📈 Outcome
This pipeline enables efficient, automated data ingestion from Spotify into Snowflake, setting a strong foundation for building data visualizations, dashboards, or analytics models based on streaming or music metadata.
